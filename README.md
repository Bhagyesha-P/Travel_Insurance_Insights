**Project Overview** 📊🌍

This project focuses on analyzing Travel Insurance data using Power BI to extract actionable insights that help insurance companies optimize offerings, improve risk management, and enhance customer experience. By exploring sales trends, commission structures, traveler demographics, and claim patterns, this analysis provides a data-driven approach to decision-making in the travel insurance industry.

**Key Objectives** 🎯

✔ Identify top-performing travel insurance products based on sales and claims data.
✔ Analyze customer demographics to determine insurance purchase patterns.
✔ Understand sales distribution across agencies, agency types, and distribution channels.
✔ Assess commission structures and their impact on agency revenue.
✔ Evaluate claim trends to improve risk assessment and fraud detection.

**Power BI Dashboards & Visualizations** 📊

This project includes interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize key metrics:

📌 Agency Performance Dashboard – Evaluation of agency contributions and sales effectiveness.

📌 Sales & Commission Dashboard – Overview of revenue trends and commission structures.

📌 Demographics Dashboard – Analysis of traveler age, gender, and trip duration.

📌 Product Insights Dashboard – Performance analysis of different insurance products.

**Challenges & Solutions** 🔄

**Challenges Faced:**

Inconsistent Data Formatting: Different date formats, currency representations, and variations in agency names caused integration issues.

Handling Missing & Incomplete Data: Some records lacked claim statuses, customer demographics, or transaction details, leading to gaps in analysis.

Slow Dashboard Performance: Large datasets resulted in slow loading sometimes and lag in Power BI reports.

**Solutions Implemented:**

✔ Standardized data formats using Python (Pandas), Power Query, and SQL to ensure consistency.

✔ Applied data imputation techniques (mean, median, mode) to fill missing values and enhance report accuracy.

✔ Optimized Power BI dashboards by reducing dataset size, using aggregations, and improving DAX calculations for real-time insights.
